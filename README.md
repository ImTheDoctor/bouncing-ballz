Bouncing Ballz

Overview

Bouncing Ballz is a simple web-based application that simulates a bouncing ball with customizable properties. Users can adjust the ball's radius, color, initial velocities, and the gravitational force acting on it. This project provides an interactive way to visualize basic physics concepts like gravity and motion.
